      <h2>Safety Insights</h2>
      <div class="blog-post">
        <h3>The Growth of Safety</h3>
        <p>From the unsafe factories of the Industrial Revolution to today’s advanced compliance systems, safety has evolved into a strategic investment for organisations.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="blog-post">
        <h3>Hazards Then vs Now</h3>
        <p><strong>Then:</strong> poor ventilation, unsafe machinery, fire, child labour.<br>
           <strong>Now:</strong> chemical exposure, ergonomics, psychosocial stress, digital fatigue, AI-related risks.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="blog-post">
        <h3>Global Responsibility</h3>
        <p>In many countries, safety is still treated as optional, leading to preventable tragedies. True progress comes only when safety is recognised as a <strong>collective responsibility</strong> shared by every worker, supervisor, and employer.</p>
